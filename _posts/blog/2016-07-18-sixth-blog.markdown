# Sixth Blog Post - With a Working Prototype

As mentioned in the previous posts, we have three main MVPs that we are concentrating on. And as mentioned earlier we are currently towards the end of implementation phase of the first MVP and have started working halfway through the Second MVP as well.

## Progress update:

We currently have a working prototype ready with the Home Page, Candidate Information page and Rank page implemented. Data Connectivity between pages and backend are done as well where we are getting the data for the candidates from open database.

### We have designed our home page as below. - Politician 360 Team Home Page

### Rank Page

The rank page ranks and lists the candidates on various basis such as popularity and sentiment analysis. It lists number of positive, negative and neutral sentiment posts by each candidate and total number of mentions for each candidate including the total number of tweets by the candidate and the total number of articles about the candidate. The page also offers the feature to search a candidate by name and see ranking and details specific to him.

#### Ranking Candidates by Popularity implemented.

### Regarding the User Evaluation plan 

Further regarding the user evaluation plan, Question list and the process for the evaluation were discussed and the list is prepared.
We have planned to promote the Poltician360 Website on social media sites and generate a survey asking a certain set of questions and requesting participants to perform certain tasks to evaluate the user experience.

## Challenges & Plan for the Upcoming Week

+ It was challenging to fix the issue with stats builder for twitter. But we managed to list the total number of tweets and articles statistics successfully. Further we are working to implement these statistics on the candidate details page.

+ We are working on listing the tweets and articles on the homepage and candidate page. We have so far succeeded in extracting the tweets. We are hoping to list it with a link on the homepage in a couple of days.

+ On progressing with the MVP 2, we are planning to move quickly to the third MVP by the coming weeks.
